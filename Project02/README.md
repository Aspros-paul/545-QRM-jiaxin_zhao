This project contains the solutions for the Quantitative Risk Management (QRM) assignment, including a PDF report with detailed explanations and a Jupyter Notebook implementing the required calculations and simulations. To run the code, ensure that Python is installed and open the Jupyter Notebook to execute Project02.ipynb step by step. Alternatively, the notebook can be converted into a Python script and run directly. Important: Before running the code, you must download the required dataset from Professor Dominic and place it in the same directory as the notebook. The report provides an analysis of the results, and all necessary files are included in the Project02 folder.
